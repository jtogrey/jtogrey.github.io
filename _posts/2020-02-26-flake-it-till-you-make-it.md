Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with the idea of putting factories in space. Watching and reading too many Sci-fi books and movies. Of course, if you are going to have factories in space you need to mine as well, to provide the raw materials. Asteroid mining has been considered for a long time and a believe there may have been one or two American startups who plan to do this. There are a huge number of benefits to producing products in space, drugs and chemicals being just one. Research on the ISS and other space experiments has shown that zero or low gravity is very beneficial to producing, growing and purity of chemicals used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. In space we have unlimited free energy in the form of our sun and earth polluting factories would no longer be a problem.

The greatest impediment to human exploration of space, is getting up there. To get a satellite into space requires a rocket and rockets are expensive even small ones. SpaceX https://www.spacex.com/ is trying to overcome some of these launch costs by developing a main booster that returns itself to earth and can be used again. This does reduce costs, but space is still a terribly expensive. To overcome this, would be to build a factory in space, for satellite construction and spaceship construction. 
 
This all seems unattainable but some of the main components in both hardware and software are begging to come to fruition. A project of this nature would require a huge amount of computing power. The development of quantum computers can produce the kind of processing power needed. Googles advances in Quantum computing https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone as well as its DeepMind artificial intelligence advancements can provide many of the answers to this problem https://deepmind.com/ 
Once we are in space, we need to manufacture parts that can be put together to create the factories of the future. 3D printing can overcome a lot of these problems, already companies are printing parts for airplanes, rockets, cars, drugs, to name a few https://www.stratasys.com/ 
Open-source software would play a major role so many of todayâ€™s machines, robotics, and rockets run on open-source Linux and Android. Cloud platforms such as AWS, and Google run on Linux and many companies use open-source data bases such as MySql.  
 
There would be a huge number of skills required for a project such as this. Engineers of every discipline, programmers, physicists, doctors, mechanics, project managers. 
The list is endless when it comes to something of this magnitude, but I have already outlined that a lot of these technologies already exist in one form or another. 
Some of what I have described already exists, we have built some of these things already, we are on our second space station, we have proven men and woman can work and live in space, we can print and assemble objects in zero gravity. 
 
Fabricating and building objects on a small scall in space is a reality, and the tools to do it already exist. The benefits of manufacturing in space are endless, energy costs are lower, chemicals are purer, new forms of growing cells are possible because of the nature of zero gravity, earth could one day be free of polluting factories. 
Then there are the countless side effects to a project like this. For every problem solved it creates new technologies that can be used in so many unrelated fields, such as medicine, drugs, chemicals, robotics, food, let alone the advancement of scientific thinking, creativity and development.   
 
I have included some links to reference material, such as Google, SpaceX and DeepMind. I have also included a number of articles published in the Verge and the pharmaceutical-journal. 
Whilst referencing this article I came across this story from Airbus https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2021/03/airbus-pioneers-first-satellite-factory-in-space.html
